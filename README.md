- I have downloaded them in https://practicalsecurityanalytics.com/pe-malware-machine-learning-dataset/

- Classified into two categories (infected and clean) by ClamAV.<br>
  - Install by this command ```apt-get install clamav clamav-daemon```<br>
  - Check whether the installation is successful or not ```clamscan --version```<br>
  - In order to copy or move a number of files, I used this one-lined script ```ls -1 <your_src_path> | head -n <number> | xargs -I {} mv <or cp> {} <your_dest_path>```
  - To count a number of files, use ```ls | wc -l```
  - You can easily scan files by enter ```clamscan```, but if you want to classified them into two categories, use ```clamscan -r --move=<your_dest_path> <your_src_path>```
