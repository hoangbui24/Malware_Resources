# Resources of malware samples for malware analyst
- I have downloaded them in https://practicalsecurityanalytics.com/pe-malware-machine-learning-dataset/
  - You should unzip it by 7z
  - To install 7z, use ```apt-get install 7zip-full```
  - To unzip, copy this ```7z x -pinfected pe-malware-machine-learning-dataset```
- Classified into two categories (infected and clean) by ClamAV.<br>
  - Install by this command ```apt-get install clamav clamav-daemon```<br>
  - Check whether the installation is successful or not ```clamscan --version```<br>
  - In order to copy or move a number of files, I used this one-lined script ```ls -1 <your_src_path> | head -n <number> | xargs -I {} mv <or cp> {} <your_dest_path>```
  - To count a number of files, use ```ls | wc -l```
  - You can easily scan files by enter ```clamscan```, but if you want to classified them into two categories, use ```clamscan -r --move=<your_dest_path> <your_src_path>```
  - In case you want to classify types of malwares, firstly, cat your scan result to a file .txt, then use this ```awk '{count += gsub(/<string you want, ex:Trojan>/, "")} END {print count}' file.txt```
